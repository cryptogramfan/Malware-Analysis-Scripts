# graph_similar_strings.py
 A script that reads a list of strings and generates link charts that clusters similar strings together. Three distance algorithms are supported to calculate string similarity: Jaccard, Hamming and Levenshtein. The script can be used as a technique for visualising phishing campaigns, for example by identifying similiar filenames and email subject lines. To use the script, supply a text file containing a list of strings. By default, the script outputs DOT files that can be exported as images using Graphviz. If Graphviz is in your PATH you can also export to PNG or SVG.

# Example usage
 $ graph_similar_strings.py -f input.txt -a A -o svg
